        Happy Birthday, my love! Today, as we celebrate your special day, I can’t help but reflect on how far we’ve come. Since 2020, when we first got to know each other, our bond has only grown stronger with every passing day. In 2021, when I proposed to you, you made my world brighter by saying yes, and since then, you’ve been my source of joy and strength, even across the miles.
        <br><br>
        Though we’re apart in this long-distance journey, the memories we’ve created—like meeting in Patna for the first time and spending those unforgettable four days together this year—are treasures I hold close to my heart. You've shown me that love knows no distance, and I am beyond blessed to call you mine.
        <br><br>
        Today, as we mark another beautiful year of knowing and loving each other, I want you to know how incredibly special you are. You bring so much light into my life, and I'm so lucky to share these moments with you. You make every day feel like a celebration, but today is all about you, my beautiful Khushboo.
        <br><br>
        May this birthday be as unforgettable as you are, filled with love, happiness, and all the wonderful things you deserve. Here’s to celebrating many more birthdays together and creating even more cherished memories.
        <br><br>
        With all my love,  
          Tmhara Baua 💝🐒
